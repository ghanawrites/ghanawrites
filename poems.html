                    TITLE: A LETTER TO THE LOVE OF MY LIFE <br> BY: ABENA SERWAH-AKOTO DARKWAH <br>( megan )

                  <p>
                    I know it's wrong - terribly wrong- to want you all for myself. It's wrong for you to even come to mind.
                    It's wrong for me to be dreaming of a forever for us when there isn't even a now. <br><br>
                    Yes, we have known. Yes, we have been. But that was wrong too, wasn't it?
                    Was wrong to know you'll be there for me when I needed someone - just one person - to break down and cry in front of.
                    It was wrong to know you'll grab my hand just when I need support.
                    It was wrong to know I could bury my face in your chest and away from the world when the winds were strong and furious;
                    away from the hardship, away from the pain.<br><br>
                    I was very wrong- gravely wrong. Because you were the hardship, you were causing my pain. I never felt that pain only because-
                    -well I don't know! I've never known, and I don't know. And I guess I'll never know.<br><br>
                    I have discovered for myself that it was and is wrong, yet I don't only want you to be my comrade.
                    I find it very surprising to know, or to realize, that I want more than just that.
                    I wanted you to be my best friend and now, I want you to love my very soul.<br><br>
                    (This is not a proposal) <br><br>
                    It is a confession I had buried in the deepest depths of my heart for so long, it's hard even as I try to get it all out.
                    I don't know how to tell you everything. I can only say that you're my curse.
                    You are my struggle in life, you are my trouble, the source of my unhappiness, my very own specially-assigned demon.
                    You destroy me. You've destroyed me; you're destroying me. How?
                    I keep wanting you. Wanting us. Wanting a friendship that existed and bloomed nothing but toxic, beautiful flowers.<br><br>
                    I would have been quite alright if I had been the one to break off this 'friendship' of ours. But no.
                    You did. I've always wanted to ask you why you stopped coming over, why you stopped confiding in me,
                    why you stopped checking up on me at the end of each day like good friends do, like good friends like ourselves did.
                    But don't worry, don't answer. I've seen that bitch. I know her well, and it's fine. <br><br>
                    She's pretty and you're beautiful. Together you're perfect, I admit. But at least we could have kept in touch.
                    You had to block me out? Completely? It was some dangerous friendship we had there and
                    I'm not being selfish by wanting it back because it was poison, danger for me alone, not you.
                    You were the poison, damn it! So you didn't have to block me out. If I wanted you to kill me, just so I could be with you,
                    that wasn't your problem. It was mine. I was to die. I don't want this life, it is devoid of you.
                    You shouldn't have blocked me out. <br><br>
                    Because it was such a great slam in the head that I scrambled to stand back up. And by the time I'd stood,
                    she'd grabbed your arm and off you were. Gone. Not dead, but gone. I wish you had died.<br><br>
                    There's one thing I cannot understand, though I see it clearly. You're poisoning her.
                    Oh yes you are, just as much, maybe more than you did me. And she's still in because she feels the same way I did
                    - scratch that- the same way I do. But you have not cut her off. And it does not look like you plan to do that anytime soon. <br>
                    I'm not jealous; just very wounded. Why would you choose her over me? <br><br>
                    (Oh but that's a stupid question)<br><br>
                    And yes, I know I'm lucky to have been delivered from a friendship, a relationship that yielded nothing but rotten fruit,
                    but I can't help it. Not when I love you this much.<br><br>
                    So every single time I see you with her, smiling, laughing, holding hands, I want to pull out my hair(if I have any).
                    And when I see you pull her in for a warm hug, I want to cut myself and scream aloud.
                    And when you whisper something in her ear and she blushes, I want to die.
                    Because that would have been me. And now? I'm light years away.<br><br>
                    So I don't want it to look like I'm desperate or pathetic (which I clearly am)
                    so I'm going to sit my behind down and torture myself watching you two go all lovey-dovey on each other.
                    And maybe kill myself on the day I see you share a kiss.<br><br>

                    i wish you could comprehend what it feels like<br>
                    to fall for you.<br>
                    and i don't mean, the simplicity<br>
                    of the action of my fall.<br>
                    it's the weight i carry of the before and after<br>
                    of it all.<br>
                    it's like i'm on a plane with my parachute in hand,<br> but i slip before i ever had the chance<br>
                    to give myself the safety that i would need to land.<br> but the fall, it felt like freedom.<br>
                    and i didn't care about the ground.<br>
                    you made me feel like i could fly and<br>
                    even land, safe and sound.<br>
                    but alas, your love lasted as long<br>
                    as my ignorance to gravity.<br> and i'm left frantically,<br> grasping at nothing,<br> and gasping for breath. <br>inching towards death. <br>and sadly, as i said,<br>
                    i carry the weight of how it feels to fall this way. <br>and it is every day.<br>
                    i let myself go and fall to the inevitable demise.<br> and i hit the ground, causing me to break<br>
                    every piece of me inside.<br>
                    but for you, i jump, rather, leap into the sky<br> because it feels so good to be in love<br>
                    with someone<br>
                    even if in the end,<br>
                    you die.<br>
